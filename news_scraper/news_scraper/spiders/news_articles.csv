Stephanie Busari and Nimi Princewill,2021-05-21T08:46:35Z,The Nigerian army says it is looking into reports that Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau has died after blowing himself up to avoid being captured by a rival group.,CNN," (CNN),The Nigerian army says it is looking into reports that ,Boko Haram, leader ,Abubakar Shekau, has died after blowing himself up to avoid being captured by a rival group.,Shekau, the long-time leader of the extremist group -- also known as Jama'atu Ahlus-Sunnah Lidda'Awati Wal Jihad (JAS) -- has waged an ,insurgency in northeast Nigeria, for more than a decade.,There were multiple reports across Nigerian media Thursday claiming that he had died by suicide rather than be taken alive following clashes with a rival group. Other reports by international news outlets suggested he was either dead or badly wounded.,Why can't Nigeria protect its children from Boko Haram?,However, it is not the first time that Shekau has been declared dead, only for him to later resurface in videos taunting his detractors. ,Nigerian Army spokesman Mohammed Yerima told CNN via a text message that the military is ""still investigating"" Shekau's reported death.,Read More,Seyi Adetayo, a former officer of Nigeria's Department of State Services, its secret service equivalent, and founder of intelligence group Eons Intelligence, told CNN that he had heard of Shekau's death from Nigerian intelligence sources.,A still from a Boko Haram propaganda video dated September 25 2016, showing leader Abubakar Shekau,  ,{""@context"": ""http://schema.org"",""@type"": ""ImageObject"",""name"": ""A still from a Boko Haram propaganda video dated September 25 2016, showing leader Abubakar Shekau,  "",""description"": ""A still from a Boko Haram propaganda video dated September 25 2016, showing leader Abubakar Shekau,  "",""url"": ""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160925152401-abubakar-shekau-0925-large-169.jpg""},""The military won't confirm his death publicly because of what has happened in the past. It was embarrassing for the army when they announced he was dead previously. They knew he was seriously wounded at the time but thought he would not survive the injury."",A source close to Boko Haram told CNN he learned Shekau died on Wednesday evening after detonating a suicide vest he was wearing.,The source is not involved with the group's activities but has had close contact over the years with some of its members.,The source told CNN that Shekau was traced to his Sambisa forest hideout and asked to surrender and plead allegiance to the Islamic State West African Province, (ISWAP) a group that broke away from Boko Haram in 2016 to align with ISIS.,Boko Haram Fast Facts,Shekau was surrounded by the ISWAP commanders who had disarmed many of the Boko Haram fighters during clashes between the two groups during the Ramadan festivities, the source said.  ,Adetayo added that his death would signal the end of ,Boko Haram, or JAS, which gained international notoriety in 2014 after kidnapping ,276 schoolgirls in Chibok, Borno State,. Over 100 of the girls remain missing to this day.,""It's an end of an era for JAS but the beginning of a new era. ISWAP is a more formidable enemy. They have a strong international network.,""Many of the commanders in JAS were having problems with Shekau before now and some of his commanders defected to ISWAP and gave intelligence to them,"" Adetayo said.",Nigerian army investigating reports that Boko Haram leader died blowing himself up to avoid capture,https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/21/africa/army-investigate-abubakar-shekau-boko-haram-leader-death-intl/index.html
Nell Lewis,2021-04-21T08:07:37Z,South African retailer Shoprite wants renewable energy to power 25% of its operations in the next five years.,CNN," (CNN),Despite South Africa averaging more than ,2,500 hours of sunshine a year,, solar energy generates less than 1% of its electricity. By contrast, the UK ,produces 4% of its electricity, from solar, with considerably ,less sunshine,.  ,South African supermarket Shoprite sees a missed opportunity.,The chain is the continent's largest food retailer, with 140,000 employees and more than 2,000 stores across 14 countries. It wants renewable energy to fuel a quarter of its operations in the next five years.,Shoprite already boasts a total of more than 480,000 square feet of solar panels on top of its 21 distribution centers and stores in South Africa and Namibia -- an area equivalent to around eight soccer fields. ,These generate enough solar energy to power 1,100 households for a year, but with every store and distribution center requiring refrigeration 24 hours a day, this accounts for less than 1% of the group's overall energy use.,Shoprite's Basson Distribution Center, on the outskirts of Cape Town, has solar panels on its roof covering an area equivalent to a soccer field.,{""@context"": ""http://schema.org"",""@type"": ""ImageObject"",""name"": ""Shoprite&#39;s Basson Distribution Center, on the outskirts of Cape Town, has solar panels on its roof covering an area equivalent to a soccer field."",""description"": ""Shoprite&#39;s Basson Distribution Center, on the outskirts of Cape Town, has solar panels on its roof covering an area equivalent to a soccer field."",""url"": ""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210409144404-shoprite-solar-panels-basson-large-169.jpg""},Read More,That may not sound like much, but it's enough to save money, according to Sanjeev Raghubir, Group Sustainability Manager at the Shoprite Group.,""The electricity bill for the whole company is in the region of 2.5 billion Rand ($167 million) ... 1% of such a large number is still quite significant,"" Raghubir tells CNN.,How solar tech could help distribute Covid-19 vaccines in Africa,To reach its 25% renewable energy target, the company announced in March that it is working with a partner (the name of which it would not disclose for commercial reasons) to build and commission utility-scale wind and solar plants, which will generate electricity that's then transported via the national grid.,It will also accelerate the rollout of rooftop solar panels and explore opportunities to build solar plants in other countries.,Moving off-grid,Shoprite is not the only company with a base in South Africa looking to develop its off-grid capabilities. In 2018, ,Siemens started building a solar mini-grid, at its Johannesburg headquarters to help reduce its dependence on the national grid, and last year, ,a Ford assembly plant, in Pretoria installed solar panels that are set to provide a third of its power.,How African trucking firms are trying to make everything cheaper,In some African countries the national grid supply can be erratic. South Africans have become used to frequent power cuts; when the state-owned power company Eskom struggles to meet demand for electricity it activates a system of scheduled outages known as "",load-shedding,"" to avoid a countrywide blackout. Last year, the country experienced almost ,860 hours of outages,. This is thought to have accelerated private investments in ,renewable energy,.  ,Deploying mini-grids can be a good solution, explains Patrick Touni, head of policy and regional strategy at GOGLA, a global association for the off-grid solar energy industry. ,Sunshine is an abundant resource across Africa and solar technology has become ""sustainable, reliable and affordable compared to the grid,"" he says. ,More than half of Shoprite's delivery trucks are fitted with solar panels to aid refrigeration.,{""@context"": ""http://schema.org"",""@type"": ""ImageObject"",""name"": ""More than half of Shoprite&#39;s delivery trucks are fitted with solar panels to aid refrigeration."",""description"": ""More than half of Shoprite&#39;s delivery trucks are fitted with solar panels to aid refrigeration."",""url"": ""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210409144717-shoprite-solar-trucks-large-169.jpg""},Investing in renewables isn't just about saving money. ""Climate change is probably the single biggest threat that we have as a business and society,"" says Raghubir, adding that it will impact the company's ability to source, process, transport and sell products, as well as affecting communities where it operates.,Shoprite has also acted to make its fleet of delivery vehicles greener. Since ,around 85%, of the nation's electricity is generated by coal, introducing electric vehicles isn't necessarily a solution, says Raghubir. ,Instead, the company has fitted solar panels to more than half of its 1,200-strong fleet of refrigerated trucks. These allow drivers to switch off the engine at delivery locations, border posts or when stuck in traffic, while keeping the refrigerators running. ,Raghubir is confident that Shoprite's efforts towards energy efficiency will benefit both the business and consumers. ,""The only way you can be affordable is if you're efficient,"" he says, ""and efficiency and environmental responsibility are best friends. The more efficient your operation is, the less energy you use, the less water you use, the less waste you produce.""",Africa's biggest supermarket chain is betting on solar power,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/21/africa/shoprite-south-africa-solar-spc-intl/index.html
Kieron Monks,2021-03-31T09:56:11Z,"Few would envy Britain's embattled National Health Service workers over the past year. One of the world's worst Covid-19 tolls has meant grueling shifts, danger, and workplaces full of grief and trauma. ",CNN,"London (CNN),Few would envy Britain's embattled National Health Service (NHS) workers over the past year. One of the ,world's worst, Covid-19 tolls has meant grueling shifts, danger, and workplaces full of grief and trauma. ,But Charles Oti would swap places with them in a heartbeat. A microbiologist by training, Nigerian by birth, Oti has spent four years working for the NHS honing a specialism in infection control.,Oti's skills are in short supply and among the UK government's ,highest priorities, for recruitment. But instead of taking a position on the front line of the pandemic response, he has been prevented from working and threatened with deportation. ,""I believe I have the skills to make a difference,"" says Oti. ""This has been so frustrating because I am being wasted."",The case represents a personal ordeal and a wider issue. At a time when Britain is heavily reliant on immigrants to staff its essential services, particularly in the NHS, many of these same workers are fighting for their right to remain in the country. ,Read More,Living in legal limbo ,Oti, 46, received a five-year residence permit when he arrived in the UK in 2013 with his partner, a European citizen.,After a spell in the private sector, he took a job with the NHS in London in 2015 as a medical devices coordinator. His regular duties included contamination control and ensuring the safety of equipment such as X-ray machines and respirators.,Better money was available in private enterprise but Oti says that public service suited him. He felt the job made more of a difference to the lives of patients and enjoyed the camaraderie within the NHS's multinational workforce which was ""like a family."" ,There, he says he formed close friendships that helped him adapt to a new country.  ,From the front lines, Black nurses battle twin pandemics of racism and coronavirus,But Oti's residence permit was revoked without his knowledge when his relationship ended, and after returning from a trip to Nigeria in 2017, he was detained at the border and ordered to leave Britain. ,Since then he has existed in a legal limbo. Several applications to remain have been denied. Oti was allowed to continue working until 2019, when the Home Office informed the NHS that his status was insecure and he was suspended without pay. ,""They tell you to stop working and it puts a person in a very difficult position,"" says Oti. ""You can't afford to make a fresh application or to appeal if it fails. One can go destitute because of this, a lot of migrants do."",Oti has avoided this fate with help from his friends and new partner -- a British citizen and NHS worker -- who have supported him while he has been unable to work. ,'Difficult to understand',In September 2020, with the pandemic raging, Oti received a job offer from the NHS for a new role in a vital position.  ,""I was supposed to be in a lab doing microbiology analysis,"" he recalls. ""There was a shortage of staff and it would have been purely Covid-19 work."",The world needs all the doctors it can get right now. This cancer patient is risking the time she has left to become one,While Oti was unable to accept the offer, he included it in his most recent submission to the Home Office. ,The application also included the Home Office's own records of a brutal hate crime in the central England town of Northampton in which Oti suffered physical and psychological trauma, that was ruled to be a case of torture. The report shows he was abducted and beaten by three men with a blunt instrument in 2014. ,Neither the attack and resulting trauma nor his job were acknowledged in the rejection letter Oti received in January 2021, which once again ordered him to leave the country or face the threat of forcible removal.,The ruling shocked his solicitors, who believe the application may not have been thoroughly examined.,""It is difficult to understand why the Home Office would want an individual with such vast experience in infection control to be forcefully removed from the UK during a pandemic."" says Maria Petrova-Collins, a London-based solicitor of law firm Duncan Lewis.,""We hope that the Home Office reviews this matter compassionately and properly considers the evidence put to them."" ,Petrova-Collins claims that if Oti were outside the UK he would be eligible for a skilled visa. ,A Home Office spokesperson declined to comment on the case, saying: ""We do not routinely comment on individual cases."",Mayor of London Sadiq Khan believes Oti's case indicates the need for urgent reform.,""Mr. Oti's situation shows the cruel and self-defeating reality of the government's hostile environment policy,"" a spokesman said. ""Despite being a highly skilled NHS worker who could contribute enormously during this pandemic, Mr Oti is being prevented from working and faces deportation from this country, which is his home."" ,""The Mayor urges the government to look again at Mr. Oti's case and to overhaul Britain's broken immigration system which is preventing health workers serving our nation during this time of crisis."",Tip of an iceberg,Oti's case is far from unique, statistics show. ,An estimated ,170,000 of the NHS workforce of 1.28 million are foreign nationals, many of whom have an insecure status. ,The Doctor's Association UK (DAUK) group is campaigning for Indefinite Leave to Remain for all NHS workers and their families, writing an, open letter, to Prime Minister Boris Johnson that notes his own recent reliance on the service. ,""Charles Oti's case represents precisely the reason DAUK have campaigned for NHS workers and dependents to be granted immediate Indefinite Leave to Remain,"" Vice-Chair Dr. Dolin Bhagawati told CNN. ,""It beggars belief that the Home Office is not playing its part in the national effort to combat a pandemic that still affects the country."",Migrant rights campaigners believe the Home Office's ""Hostile Environment"" policies, ,launched in 2012,, are to blame. ,Those policies, aimed at deterring illegal immigration, introduced more stringent and frequent checks on immigration status that increased the difficulty of accessing services and left migrants more vulnerable. ,In the most notorious case of the ""Windrush"" generation, legal arrivals from the Commonwealth were cut off from housing, healthcare and banking services, and in some cases deported. ,The ,government has since apologized,, commissioned an ,independent review,, and established a compensation mechanism.,Coronavirus may force the UK to rethink its relationship with migrant workers,""The Home Office has a long history of treating migrants with disdain and cruelty,"" says Minnie Rahman of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI). ,""The Windrush Lessons Learned review showed how deeply the Home Office needs fundamental and meaningful reform, but the Government has so far failed to act."",The government has ,introduced, free visa extensions for around 3,000 health and care workers, which unions ,have criticized, as it excludes thousands more. ,Oti's solicitors are now pursuing a judicial review of the case, which they say is his last hope. A crowdfunding appeal for his legal fees has raised around £2,700 ($3,700).,For Oti, the pandemic has highlighted the need for people to work across boundaries as our fates are invariably connected.  ,""When you walk into a hospital, the consultant who sees you might be a migrant, and the nurse supporting the consultant could be a migrant,"" he says.  ""When something goes wrong (like the pandemic) it can affect everybody.""","He should be on the frontline of the pandemic response. Instead, he is facing deportation",https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/31/africa/britain-nhs-healthworker-deportation-cmd-intl/index.html

",CNN,"  (CNN),When the coronavirus pandemic ground China to a near-halt in early February last year, Youssouf Dieng jetted back to Dakar for, he thought, a brief sojourn.  ,In reality, it was a year before Dieng -- who had worked as a goods trader in the manufacturing hub of Guangzhou in southern China for two decades -- could return, on an air ticket three times the usual cost, and a complicated business visa.

While that figure was never verified, it pointed to the generally accepted opinion that, between 2005 and 2012, at least, this was the largest African expatriate community in Asia. ,Read More,As ,interracial marriages in the community flourished,, Bodomo theorized that, in time, an African-Chinese minority would arise, becoming China's 57th ethnic group and demanding full citizenship rights. Today, that looks unlikely. By April last year, just ,4,550 Africans, were living in Guangzhou, according to local authorities, including students and diplomats as well as businesspeople.   ,Ten months on, more than a dozen experts and Africans who spoke with CNN said that number has further dwindled, due to several repatriation flights to Nigeria and Kenya, and tougher coronavirus-era visa rules, with most foreigners ,barred from entry to China,.  Many who remain are rooted in China by Chinese wives and children.,""For the whole issue of African traders in Guangzhou, I suspect that era is over,"" says Gordon Mathews, professor and chair of the Department of Anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""I'm skeptical that (their physical presence in the city), ,will ever be at the scale that it has been.""  ,The business case,One reason for the decline of the African community over the past year is strictly business.,In 2019 alone, of the 2.95 million foreigners entering China through Guangzhou, 358,000 were from African countries, according to local officials. Many came on quick visits to buy from the region's factories, using African residents as middlemen to connect with Chinese wholesalers.  ,When ,Covid-19, prevented foreigners from visiting China, the factory owners of the Pearl River Delta -- often cited as the world's biggest urban area -- had to rethink their business model. ,Many in the area, which includes the cities of Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Foshan and Dongguan, began advertising their services on e-commerce giants such as Alibaba. This allowed them to connect with African customers directly, rather than waiting for them to come to the city in person to place orders, as had been the way for decades.  ,Pat Chukwuonye Chike has been in Guangzhou for nearly two decades, living on a business visa he renews each year. When Covid-19 hit, he stayed to avoid being separated from his Chinese wife and three African-Chinese children. He shuttered his clothing store, previously frequented by droves of visiting foreigners, and set up an Alibaba-type service on ,Facebook,, which is banned in China but can be accessed via a virtual private netwoprk (VPN).,Pak Chukwuonye Chike doing business with Chinese counterparts in Guangzhou during the pandemic.,{""@context"": ""http://schema.org"",""@type"": ""ImageObject"",""name"": ""Pak Chukwuonye Chike doing business with Chinese counterparts in Guangzhou during the pandemic."",""description"": ""Pak Chukwuonye Chike doing business with Chinese counterparts in Guangzhou during the pandemic."",""url"": ""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210318101526-pak-chukwuonye-chike-large-169.jpg""},His online shop, Africa China Trade Service, connects about 20 factories he knows to his contacts in Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Guinea and Ghana. The advantage, he says, is his clients know they're dealing with factories they can trust.,But it's a competitive landscape. There are now hundreds of thousands of Chinese migrants in Africa who can easily order from Chinese factories themselves, and sell to locals where they are living -- cutting Africans out of the equation in their home nations. ,Some say that's what the Chinese authorities would prefer.,""China wants to be the middleman and not have Africans (in its borders),"" says Mathews, author of ""The World in Guangzhou."" ""So it would make much more sense for the Chinese merchants to move to Africa, rather than having the Africans go to China.""  ,Racial tensions,For centuries, Guangzhou has intermittently been a nerve center for migrants, whether internal or foreign. When African traders arrived in the city in the early 2000s, they formed a particularly visible enclave -- partly because they tended to congregate in one or two relatively small areas, and partly because black skin had not before been widely seen in China in large numbers.,The Africans also brought with them value systems that did not easily fit in with China's political environment.,Many were deeply religious, founding underground Christian churches, which sometimes attracted Chinese congregations -- a deeply contentious practice in a country where proselytizing by foreigners is illegal. As Beijing clamped down on non-state sanctioned religion in recent years, their house churches were raided and shut down by local police.,The Denfeng area of Guangzhou, in which Little Africa is located, has seen an increased police presence in recent years.,{""@context"": ""http://schema.org"",""@type"": ""ImageObject"",""name"": ""The Denfeng area of Guangzhou, in which Little Africa is located, has seen an increased police presence in recent years."",""description"": ""The Denfeng area of Guangzhou, in which Little Africa is located, has seen an increased police presence in recent years."",""url"": ""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210318101300-guangzhou-africa-2-large-169.jpg""},Africans from Muslim nations also continued to practice Islam, a religion Guangzhou has a long connection with, being home to ,China's oldest mosque,. Guangzhou attracted communities of Hui and Uyghurs, Muslim minorities in China, who began serving halal food to the African incomers, as did a range of Middle Eastern eateries. But in recent years, as hostility to Islamic populations increased across China in the wake of the crackdown on Islam in the country's western region of Xinjiang, Africans have reported that restaurants serving halal food began to remove Arabic writing from their menus and signage.,Africans also formed small democracies within their own communities, voting for a head of each nation within Guangzhou, to lobby on their behalf with the local authorities on matters such as visas. Permanent residency for foreigners is extremely rare in China, and most African parents live in a status of constantly renewing one-year visas.  ,A Chinese woman in Guangzhou with her baby in 2016.,{""@context"": ""http://schema.org"",""@type"": ""ImageObject"",""name"": ""A Chinese woman in Guangzhou with her baby in 2016."",""description"": ""A Chinese woman in Guangzhou with her baby in 2016."",""url"": ""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210318101154-guangzhou-african-children-large-169.jpg""},Those who cannot secure these often simply overstayed, creating an underground population of illegal African migrants in the city. A leaked ,WikiLeaks, cable from 2008 revealed the central government was concerned by this, and had quietly funded research into the African community's impact on crime, underground religion and missed tax revenue. ,In 2011, the provincial authorities clamped down on overstayers, offering rewards to Chinese who turned them in, and making it illegal for employers, hoteliers or educational institutes to serve them. ,An increased police presence was seen in Little Africa from 2015 onwards.,{""@context"": ""http://schema.org"",""@type"": ""ImageObject"",""name"": ""An increased police presence was seen in Little Africa from 2015 onwards."",""description"": ""01 China guangzhou little africa"",""url"": ""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200410142512-01-china-guangzhou-little-africa-large-169.jpg""},Then, in 2014, the government embarked on the "",beautification,"" of Little Africa, the once-rural village consumed by the city. The campaign tore down signage in the area that celebrated foreign trade, swept up street stalls serving local cuisines, and introduced a heavy police presence. ,As policing of the community increased, several Africans running logistics warehouses told CNN that police installed CCTV cameras inside their premises, as well as X-ray scanners and devices plugged into their WiFi routers, in an apparent bid to clamp down on illegal exports.  ,CNN reached out to officials in Guangdong, the province of which Guangzhou is the capital, for comments on these claims but did not receive a response.    ,Racism in China,While many Africans spoke of leaving Guangzhou in the years leading up to the pandemic, much of the community remained, often rooted by marriages, children, a lack of better opportunity in Africa or elsewhere, and ultimately a sense of home. ,While there is no official data on how many Africans in Guangzhou married Chinese women, a walk through the strip malls of Little Africa in recent years made it clear: scores of shops are run by an African husband and his Chinese wife, with their children running down the corridors. ,Yet that sense of belonging was rocked for many last April when Africans across the city were ,evicted from their homes, and hotels, and forced to live on the streets. After a handful of Nigerians tested positive for Covid-19, Guangzhou authorities quarantined and tested Africans all across the city, sparking unproven fears that Africans were vectors of the virus.,Last year, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said: ""The Chinese government treats all foreigners in China equally, opposes any differentiated practices targeted at specific groups of people, and has zero tolerance for discriminatory words and actions."", .m-html5-video--1586499144310 { display: block; margin: 0 0 1em; position: relative; width: 100%; } .m-html5-video--1586499144310 video { display: block; width: 100%; } , , , , , , ,An African in Guangzhou is tested for coronvirus at his apartment.,Still, Vassor Dieng, a sofa seller in Senegal who imports from China, remembers that incident, which went viral on Twitter in Africa. She says she has no desire to go to Guangzhou once coronavirus restrictions lift. ""I'm hesitant now to go to China from what I have heard since Covid started, and how they treat people,"" she says.  ,Back in Guangzhou, Nigerian father-of-three Chike says the way he is treated by some Chinese residents in his home city makes him feel they suspect Africans ""are the virus."" It's something, he says, he tries not to think about. ""Not everyone is comfortable in another country,"" he adds.,Many Africans in Guangzhou, however, report the city's Public Security Bureau has been lenient with visas for those with Chinese partners and children during the pandemic. Normally, a foreigner would have to leave and reenter China to activate a visa, something several Africans told CNN they had not been made to do, as it would trigger the need for a long quarantine.,Felly Mwamba in Winnipeg, Canada.,{""@context"": ""http://schema.org"",""@type"": ""ImageObject"",""name"": ""Felly Mwamba in Winnipeg, Canada."",""description"": ""Felly Mwamba in Winnipeg, Canada."",""url"": ""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210303090246-felly-mwanwamba-large-169.jpg""},Despite the challenges, many Africans want to return to their old lives in China. Congolese trader Felly Mwamba left the country during the Lunar New Year holiday in 2020 and has been living in Winnipeg since. After two decades in Guangzhou, he'd earned enough money to apply for Canadian citizenship and buy a home there, but the Winnipeg winter has been bitterly, ,cold and he says he has few friends.,Yet he cannot get back into China. His business visa expired while he was in Canada, and to get a new one requires an invitation letter from local officials -- hard for him to obtain from another continent., ,In the meantime, he is paying rent on his office and apartment in China.,He's considering closing his languishing logistics business there, if he can't return soon. ""If really it is consistent going on like this, then I prefer to get out and relax,"" he said. ""See if I can do something in Africa."",The legacy  ,Whatever their future, the heyday of African trade, life and love in Guangzhou has produced a generation of African-Chinese children.

They fell in love, and moved to Brazzaville. But after her father died when she was a toddler, she grew up in China with her grandparents: they renamed her Zhong Fei Fei -- a name that roughly translates to China-Africa.,Since then, she says she has grappled with not being, ,""Chinese enough"" in China. She said a Shanghai school teacher once told her class she spoke Mandarin well for a ""foreigner."" ""I was so confused because how come I'm the foreigner?"" she remembers thinking. ,But she also has dealt with not being considered black enough in Congo. ,Last year, her identity came to the fore when producers of the Chinese version of K-pop reality TV show ""Produce Camp 2020"" invited her to star in the series.   ,When Zhong emerged from the show, she was a trending topic on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform, but not for the right reasons -- many were attacking her for her race. ""I was looking at my phone and I had like 200,000 messages or something,"" she says of reconnecting to the world after exiting the show. The online attacks came at the same time authorities in Guangzhou were accused of mistreating Africans there.,Zhong Fei Fei grew up in Shanghai, the daughter of a Congolese father and Chinese mother.,{""@context"": ""http://schema.org"",""@type"": ""ImageObject"",""name"": ""Zhong Fei Fei grew up in Shanghai, the daughter of a Congolese father and Chinese mother."",""description"": ""Zhong Fei Fei grew up in Shanghai, the daughter of a Congolese father and Chinese mother."",""url"": ""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210318100639-zhong-fei-fei-2-large-169.jpg""},Yet Zhong says she also received messages of support, and subsequently used the platform to launch a music career. ,For families in Guangzhou, Afro-Chinese celebrities like Zhong could be helpful for their children. Pastor Ignatius, a Nigerian evangelical preacher who has three African-Chinese children under the age of 12, hopes that ""what is happening in Japan might happen here,"" referencing the Afro-Japanese community there, from which many celebrated figures have emerged, such as tennis player Naomi Osaka.,""What we see from the school, they are very accepting -- though there are times of student discrimination here,"" he says, of the public Chinese school his children attend in Guangzhou. They all have Chinese passports -- without one, they would not be eligible for free education or healthcare. Dual nationality is  forbidden. ,Chike, who also has three African-Chinese children under age 13, says while there is ""more discrimination"" for the family to contend with in recent years, ""as long as my kids know who I am, where I'm from,"" they are free to live in the society they feel will be most beneficial. ,Mathews, the Hong Kong-based anthropologist, previously speculated during the height of African migration to Guangzhou that the African community could provide China with its own Barack Obama figure -- a non-Han leader. In an era of growing nationalism, he now believes this community of Afro-Chinese children will more likely dilute to the point where they won't have a collective voice. ,""They will probably blend in the overall landscape of Guangzhou because it has so many people from all over the place,"" says Mathews. ""I don't think they'll be noticeable ... it will be a few hundred people.""",Covid-19 drove hundreds of Africans out of Guangzhou.

In Africa, this change in habits has international investors eyeing the lucrative opportunity to bring the unbanked online. ,These digital platforms could help expand financial inclusion on the continent, where more than half of people over the age of 15 in sub-Saharan Africa lacked access to a bank or mobile money account as of 2017 according to the ,World Bank,.,Nigeria alone has more than 200 financial technology (fintech) companies, with the sector attracting global interest from companies such as ,Mastercard, and ,Visa,. ,According to a recent report from consulting firm ,McKinsey & Company,, funding for Nigerian fintech companies between 2014 and 2019 topped $600 million. In 2019, outside investment in Nigerian fintech startups accounted for a quarter of all funding for tech startups across Africa. ,One of the largest deals took place last October, when US-based digital payment powerhouse Stripe acquired Nigeria's Paystack, reportedly for over ,$200 million,.

Did you think it was going to get this big when you started?,Shola Akinlade: ,We started Paystack from a personal pain. I've been seeing how things work elsewhere ... and I thought, 'Why can't we have good things here?' I think that was where it came from and, personally, just wanting things to be easier. I wasn't thinking, 'Oh, this is going to be big at all.' But I got into Y Combinator [which provides ,seed funding, for startups] in Silicon Valley.,And when I went to San Francisco, we saw people building amazing things. People were building shirts that never get dirty or a bra that detects breast cancer. I was initially intimidated when they said, 'What are you guys working on? ... How many people are in Africa?' I was like, 'One billion.' That was the moment I realized that this is going to be very big.

We invited our customers and said, 'What features should we build?' And everyone said ... 'We want you to let customers know that paying online is safe; paying online works.' One of the things we know at Paystack is if someone has a problem paying online with a merchant, that is someone that will never pay online again -- so we take that very seriously. We make sure that refunds get delivered instantly (and) disputes are resolved. ,EG: We've seen the pandemic accelerating digitization. How has that influenced the way your customers are engaging with you in terms of your business' growth?   ,SA: ,Now we're doing probably more than five times more sign-ups than we were doing in March (of 2020).

Today we're in just three countries. Africa has over 50 countries. So we need to scale rapidly across the continent. I think there's a lot that's going to happen in the continent and Paystack will build that infrastructure that allows us to scale across the continent.,EG: We keep saying that we can leapfrog legacy requirements and industrialization in a way, and just fast forward to AI and the digital world. Is that really possible? How do you see this playing out as someone who is a pioneer within the space of the digital world for the continent?  ,SA: ,I think the way ecosystems are built is everybody doing their part. I'll do my part, the person building the roads, she'll do her part. So I think it's not a zero-sum game. We will play our part on the technology side, but we need the roads, we need things with good governance. We need more things in different directions. We need people to help us tell our stories.

What would you go back and tell your younger self?  Perhaps it would be to take more risks, or to not let others steal your joy. For Miishe Addy, it would be three simple words: trust your intuition.,Addy is the co-founder and CEO of Jetstream Africa, a technology-enabled logistics company focusing on cross-border trade. Ghanaian by heritage and American by birth, she grew up in Texas and earned a philosophy degree from Harvard. But she always felt a pull to do something more innovative and impactful.,After moving to Ghana in 2017, an opportunity to innovate presented itself in an unexpected way. So, she followed her intuition and dove head-first into the male-dominated shipping logistics industry -- launching Jetstream in a country where women-run businesses are not only common, they are celebrated.,Globally, Ghana consistently ranks near the top for the number of women-owned businesses. A ,2020 report, found that 36.5% of all businesses in the country are owned by women -- the third-highest ranking out of the 58 world economies included the study and higher than countries such as the US, Spain and Australia.,Addy, pictured here in May 2020 negotiating cargo space on Ethiopian Airlines flights, is the co-founder and CEO of logistics company Jetstream Africa.,{""@context"": ""http://schema.org"",""@type"": ""ImageObject"",""name"": ""Addy, pictured here in May 2020 negotiating cargo space on Ethiopian Airlines flights, is the co-founder and CEO of logistics company Jetstream Africa."",""description"": ""Addy, pictured here in May 2020 negotiating cargo space on Ethiopian Airlines flights, is the co-founder and CEO of logistics company Jetstream Africa."",""url"": ""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210325085643-02-miishe-addy-ceo-jetstream-africa-large-169.jpg""},Now, three years in and with her company growing, CNN recently spoke to Addy to get a first-person perspective on being a female entrepreneur, what she has gained from her experience, and why with that journey comes a sense of responsibility to lend a helping hand to the women coming after her.,Read More,This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. ,CNN: What brought you to Ghana? ,Miishe Addy:, I moved to Ghana to teach business at a startup incubator in Accra and spend time with my extended family. When I arrived at Kotoka International Airport [in Accra] in 2017, there were signs everywhere that Ghana was developing fast. New housing compounds were springing up in what used to be forest areas, market women selling wares on the side of the road were using mobile phones, and I wasn't hearing the constant hum of generators as businesses were relying more on the national electricity company. Pre-Covid, Ghana was officially one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. The pandemic slowed that growth, but demographics, governance, and economic fundamentals still point to a recovery this year.,Nigeria's 'techpreneurs' are using technology to provide life-changing solutions to everyday problems ,CNN: What is your favorite thing about your career choice?  ,MA:, My favorite thing about my career choice in tech entrepreneurship is the ability to make an impact. Technology is like nothing else in the sense that a relatively small team of people who build a technology platform that's relevant to the market can impact hundreds, thousands, even millions of people within a relatively short timeframe -- and (have) the ability to create things that are of value to other people and scale those things across countries, across geographical boundaries, across cultures. That's incredibly rewarding. ,CNN: What have you learned about yourself as an entrepreneur and CEO?  ,MA:, The most important thing I've learned about myself is that my intuition is often right. The things that I believe are going to happen in the world and that are going to materialize are accurate. And sometimes I doubt my intuition, or I'll ask a lot of people for their opinions because I want to get things right. But more often than not, when I'm the one closest to the problem, I have a big picture view of what the solution is. In many cases, I'm the best person to know what the answer is and where the market is going. ,CNN: Speaking of problems, how has the pandemic affected your business?  ,MA:, The second wave of Covid has hit the continent hard, but it has also accelerated trends toward digitization that were already happening in the shipping industry. Jetstream tripled our revenues and customer base last year, and this year we saw over 1,000 sign-ups for our mobile technology by logistics vendors who, two years ago, would not use their mobile phones for anything other than WhatsApp and phone calls. ,These women are shaping the future of African space exploration,CNN: Is it harder for a woman in Ghana to start out in the tech sector as opposed to other countries?   ,MA:, I would generally say it's easier to be an entrepreneur as a woman in Ghana than in other countries. There are so many women entrepreneurs in this country who are doing amazing businesses in many different sectors. Technology specifically is a little harder in Ghana because there are so few women with engineering backgrounds or who have the capabilities to build an engineering or technology-based business.  ,CNN: What roles have your parents played in your life?  ,MA: ,Both of my parents are inspirations. My dad is an inventor, investor, and entrepreneur. He developed a groundbreaking sterilization device for Johnson & Johnson in the 1990s that is still used globally today. He's gone on to lead and invest in businesses and development projects in Asia and Africa. My mom is a whip-smart rabble-rouser who grew up in a military family, studied economics at Stanford, and now consults a bunch of manufacturing and logistics companies in Ghana.

It's really about hard work and curiosity. I think over time, the biggest factor in my growth and in my company's growth has been our willingness to stay humble and to be wrong and to admit when we're wrong, and to fix our solution every time it's wandering astray from the problem. The entire business has grown on the basis of continually applying ourselves to a better understanding of the market and what we're doing. So, I would say humility and a growth-oriented mindset have been key. ,CNN: What advice would you give to young women starting out in the tech innovation field?   ,MA:, I think the key advice I would give to young women who are starting out, especially in technology entrepreneurship, is this notion of coming to solve problems that need you; coming when you're called, not when you're ready. And so, I think for many high-achieving women or women who are creative problem solvers, many times there's a lot of pressure to get things perfect or to get things right. And I would say that if you have an idea of a problem that you want to solve, and you have the intuition that technology could make that solution scale bigger or faster or to more people, do it.

""I couldn't cry anymore. We sold our land, camels, maize, crops.

There were an estimated 437 kidnapping incidents with 2,879 victims for the whole of 2020, ,NST figures show. ,Although Asch Harwood, who oversees the tracker, told CNN these figures are likely underestimated due to under-reporting of kidnapping cases. ,Kidnapping has been prevalent in the oil-rich south of Nigeria for decades as militants fight for control over resources. They kidnapped foreign oil workers and expatriates to attract international attention to their cause. Similarly, the Islamist militant group Boko Haram has carried out thousands of kidnappings in the 12-year insurgency waged in the country's northeast.,However, the landscape has now changed and the new wave of kidnappers are not agitating for political or religious ideology, their motive is simply to make money, analysts say.,""Kidnapping has morphed from being ideological, like in the Delta region, where they pressed for demands and control for resources. What we have now is purely criminal and that is what is driving the trend now,"" says Don Okereke, a Nigerian security analyst.,It is a phenomenon described by Matthew Page, an associate fellow on the Africa program at Chatham House think tank, as ""violence entrepreneurship."",Marauding groups, known locally as bandits, operate from forest enclaves in northwestern Nigeria, where they organize attacks and kidnappings on rural areas and Nigeria's major road networks.,.m-infographic_1619443198869{background:url(//cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2021/04/26/01-Zamfara_Nigeria_kidnapping_375px.png) no-repeat 0 0 transparent;margin-bottom:30px;width:100%;-moz-background-size:cover;-o-background-size:cover;-webkit-background-size:cover;background-size:cover;font-size:0;}.m-infographic_1619443198869:before{content:"""";display:block;padding-top:246.07%;}@media (min-width:640px) {.m-infographic_1619443198869 {background-image:url(//cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2021/04/26/01-Zamfara_Nigeria_kidnapping_780px.png);}.m-infographic_1619443198869:before{padding-top:86.68%;}}@media (min-width:1120px) {.m-infographic_1619443198869 {background-image:url(//cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2021/04/26/01-Zamfara_Nigeria_kidnapping_930px.png);}.m-infographic_1619443198869:before{padding-top:72.7%;}},Between June 2011 and the end of March 2020, an ,estimated $18.34 million was paid in ransoms,, according to Lagos-based SBM Intelligence in a report last year titled ""The economics of the kidnap industry in Nigeria."",Former Nigerian senator, Shehu Sani, who helped in negotiations to free some of the ,kidnapped Chibok schoolgirls,, estimates that the true figure is far higher.,""Just in the last five years, even at a rough estimate, over $100 million has been paid by either individuals or organizations to terror groups, or to bandits for ransom ... thousands of people have also been killed, and millions of people have been displaced,"" he tells CNN.,Sani says the bandits are often ruthless and execute people who fail to meet their ransom demands -- and make the families pay to pick up their bodies.,""I know family members who went to pay ransoms after the deadline but had to pay to pick up the corpse. Ransom encourages kidnapping, but refusal to pay a ransom will lead to the slaughter of innocent persons,"" he says.,In 2017, ,Nigeria's senate approved the death sentence, for kidnappings in instances where they lead to deaths but many Nigerians don't risk reporting to security agencies for fear their family members will be harmed.

,Abraham began burying the bodies in the morning and didn't stop until nightfall.  ,The corpses, some dressed in white church robes drenched in blood, were scattered in arid fields, scrubby farmlands and a dry riverbed. Others had been shot on their doorsteps with their hands bound with belts. Among the dead were priests, old men, women, entire families and a group of more than 20 Sunday school children, some as young as 14, according to eyewitnesses, parents and their teacher.   ,Abraham recognized some of the children immediately. They were from his town in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region, Edaga Hamus, and had also fled fighting there two weeks earlier. As clashes raged, Abraham and his family, along with hundreds of other displaced people, escaped to Dengelat, a nearby village in a craggy valley ringed by steep, rust-colored cliffs. They sought shelter at Maryam Dengelat, a historic monastery complex famed for a centuries-old, rock-hewn church.  ,'use strict';CNN.Videx = CNN.Videx || {};CNN.Videx.mobile = {};CNN.INJECTOR.executeFeature('video').then(function () {CNN.VideoPlayer.handleUnmutePlayer = function handleUnmutePlayer(containerId, dataObj) {'use strict';var playerInstance,playerPropertyObj,rememberTime,unmuteCTA,unmuteIdSelector = 'unmute_' + containerId,isPlayerMute;dataObj = dataObj || {};if (CNN.VideoPlayer.getLibraryName(containerId) === 'fave') {playerInstance = FAVE.player.getInstance(containerId) || null;} else {playerInstance = containerId && window.cnnVideoManager.getPlayerByContainer(containerId).videoInstance.cvp || null;}isPlayerMute = (typeof dataObj.muted === 'boolean') ? dataObj.muted : false;if (CNN.VideoPlayer.playerProperties && CNN.VideoPlayer.playerProperties[containerId]) {playerPropertyObj = CNN.VideoPlayer.playerProperties[containerId];}if (playerPropertyObj.mute && playerPropertyObj.contentPlayed) {if (isPlayerMute === false) {unmuteCTA = jQuery(document.getElementById(unmuteIdSelector));playerInstance.unmute();if (unmuteCTA.length > 0) {unmuteCTA.removeClass('video__unmute--active').addClass('video__unmute--inactive');unmuteCTA.off('click');rememberTime = 0;if (rememberTime < 0) {rememberTime = 360 / 60;}CNN.Utils.storeLocalValue('unmute_africa', 'X', rememberTime);}} else {playerInstance.mute();}}};CNN.VideoPlayer.showFlashSlate = function showFlashSlate(container) {'use strict';var $vidEndSlate;$vidEndSlate = container.parent().find('.js-video__end-slate').eq(0);if ($vidEndSlate.length > 0) {$vidEndSlate.find('.l-container').html('<a href=""https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/"" target=""_blank""><div class=""flash-slate""></div></a>');$vidEndSlate.removeClass('video__end-slate--inactive').addClass('video__end-slate--active');}};CNN.autoPlayVideoExist = (CNN.autoPlayVideoExist === true) ? true : false;var configObj = {thumb: 'none',video: 'world/2021/02/27/ethiopia-tigray-massacre-church-dengelat-lon-orig.cnn',width: '100%',height: '100%',section: 'domestic',profile: 'expansion',network: 'cnn',markupId: 'body-text_9',theoplayer: {allowNativeFullscreen: true},adsection: 'const-article-inpage',frameWidth: '100%',frameHeight: '100%',posterImageOverride: {""mini"":{""width"":220,""type"":""jpg"",""uri"":""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210226191714-deengelat-church-card-small-169.jpg"",""height"":124},""xsmall"":{""width"":307,""type"":""jpg"",""uri"":""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210226191714-deengelat-church-card-medium-plus-169.jpg"",""height"":173},""small"":{""width"":460,""type"":""jpg"",""uri"":""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210226191714-deengelat-church-card-large-169.jpg"",""height"":259},""medium"":{""width"":780,""type"":""jpg"",""uri"":""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210226191714-deengelat-church-card-exlarge-169.jpg"",""height"":438},""large"":{""width"":1100,""type"":""jpg"",""uri"":""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210226191714-deengelat-church-card-super-169.jpg"",""height"":619},""full16x9"":{""width"":1600,""type"":""jpg"",""uri"":""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210226191714-deengelat-church-card-full-169.jpg"",""height"":900},""mini1x1"":{""width"":120,""type"":""jpg"",""uri"":""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210226191714-deengelat-church-card-small-11.jpg"",""height"":120}}},autoStartVideo = false,isVideoReplayClicked = false,callbackObj,containerEl,currentVideoCollection = [],currentVideoCollectionId = '',isLivePlayer = false,mediaMetadataCallbacks,mobilePinnedView = null,moveToNextTimeout,mutePlayerEnabled = false,nextVideoId = '',nextVideoUrl = '',turnOnFlashMessaging = false,videoPinner,videoEndSlateImpl;if (CNN.autoPlayVideoExist === false) {autoStartVideo = false;autoStartVideo = typeof CNN.isLoggedInVideoCheck === 'function' ?

The holy day was a welcome respite from weeks of violence, but it would not last.  ,Read More,A group of Eritrean soldiers opened fire on Maryam Dengelat church while hundreds of congregants were celebrating mass, eyewitnesses say.

Mothers were forced to tie up their sons. A pregnant woman was shot, her husband killed. Some of the survivors hid under the bodies of the dead.,The mayhem continued for three days, with soldiers slaughtering local residents, displaced people and pilgrims. Finally, on December 2, the soldiers allowed informal burials to take place, but threatened to kill anyone they saw mourning. Abraham volunteered. ,

,Under their watchful eyes, he held back tears as he sorted through the bodies of children and teenagers, collecting identity cards from pockets and making meticulous notes about their clothing or hairstyle. Some were completely unrecognizable, having been shot in the face, Abraham said.     ,Then he covered their bodies with earth and thorny tree branches, praying that they wouldn't be washed away, or carried off by prowling hyenas and circling vultures. Finally he placed their shoes on top of the burial mounds, so he could return with their parents to identify them.  ,One was Yohannes Yosef, who was just 15.   ,""Their hands were tied ... young children ... we saw them everywhere.

He accused the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which ruled Ethiopia for nearly three decades before Abiy took office in 2018, of attacking a government military base and trying to steal weapons. The TPLF denies the claim. ,The conflict is the culmination of escalating tensions between the two sides, and the most dire of several recent ethno-nationalist clashes in Africa's second-most populous country.  ,After seizing control of Tigray's main cities in late November, Abiy declared victory and maintained that, no civilians were harmed, in the offensive. Abiy has also denied that soldiers from Eritrea crossed into Tigray to support Ethiopian forces.,.m-infographic_1614377752351{background:url(//cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2021/02/26/dengelat-map-375px-3.png) no-repeat 0 0 transparent;margin-bottom:30px;width:100%;-moz-background-size:cover;-o-background-size:cover;-webkit-background-size:cover;background-size:cover;font-size:0;}.m-infographic_1614377752351:before{content:"""";display:block;padding-top:243.73%;}@media (min-width:640px) {.m-infographic_1614377752351 {background-image:url(//cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2021/02/26/dengelat-map-930px-3.png);}.m-infographic_1614377752351:before{padding-top:88.12%;}}@media (min-width:1120px) {.m-infographic_1614377752351 {background-image:url(//cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2021/02/26/dengelat-map-930px-3.png);}.m-infographic_1614377752351:before{padding-top:88.12%;}},But the fighting has raged on in rural and mountainous areas where the TPLF and its armed supporters are reportedly hiding out, resisting Abiy's drive to consolidate power. The violence has spilled over into local communities, catching civilians in the crossfire and triggering what the ,United Nations refugee agency, has called the worst flight of refugees from the region in two decades.    ,The ,UN special adviser on genocide prevention, said in early February that the organization had received multiple reports of ""extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, looting, mass executions and impeded humanitarian access.""    ,Many of those abuses have been blamed on Eritrean soldiers, whose presence on the ground suggests that Abiy's much-lauded peace deal with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki set the stage for the two sides to wage war against the TPLF -- their mutual enemy. ,The US State Department, in a statement to CNN, called for Eritrean forces to be ""withdrawn from Tigray immediately,"" citing credible reports of their involvement in ""deeply troubling conduct."" In response to CNN's findings, the spokesperson said ""reports of a massacre at Maryam Dengelat are gravely concerning and demand an independent investigation."",Ethiopia responded to CNN's request for comment with a statement that did not directly address the attack in Dengelat. The government said it would ""continue bringing all perpetrators to justice following thorough investigations into alleged crimes in the region,"" but gave no details about those investigations.,

,More than three weeks after CNN published this investigation, the Eritrean embassy of the UK and Ireland responded on March 22 by denying allegations of wrongdoing by Eritrean soldiers and denying that Eritrean troops were in Ethiopia.,The TPLF said in a statement to CNN that its forces were nowhere near Dengelat at the time of the massacre. It rejected that the victims could have been mistaken for being TPLF and called for a UN investigation to hold all sides accountable for atrocities committed during the conflict.,Still, the situation inside the country remains opaque. Ethiopia's government has severely restricted access to journalists and ,prevented most aid, from reaching areas beyond the government's control, making it challenging to verify accounts from survivors. And an intermittent communications blackout during the fighting has effectively blocked the war from the world's eyes.  ,Now that curtain is being pulled back, as witnesses fleeing parts of Tigray reach internet access and phone lines are restored. They detail a disastrous conflict that has given rise to ethnic violence, including attacks on churches and mosques. ,For months, rumors spread of a grisly assault on an Orthodox church in Dengelat. A list of the dead began circulating on social media in early December, shared among the Tigrayan diaspora. Then photos of the deceased, including young children, started cropping up online.    ,Through a network of activists and relatives, CNN tracked down eyewitnesses to the attack. In countless phone calls -- many disconnected and dropped -- Abraham and others provided the most detailed account of the deadly massacre to date. ,

	,Footage of the 2019 festival shows congregants celebrating outside the church. ,Credit: Bernadette Gilbertas,
,Eyewitnesses said that the festival started much as it had any other year. Footage of the celebrations from 2019 shows priests dressed in white ceremonial robes and crowns, carrying crosses aloft, leading hundreds of people in prayer at Maryam Dengelat church. The faithful sang, danced and ululated in unison.   ,As prayers concluded in the early hours of November 30, Abraham looked out from the hilltop where the church is perched to see troops arriving by foot, followed by more soldiers in trucks. At first, they were peaceful, he said. They were invited to eat, and rested under the shade of a tree grove.     ,But, as congregants were celebrating mass around midday, shelling and gunfire erupted, sending people fleeing up mountain paths and into nearby homes. ,Desta, who helped with preparations for the festival, said he was at the church when troops arrived at the village entrance, blocking off the road and firing shots. He heard people screaming and fled, running up Ziqallay mountainside. From the rocky plateau he surveyed the chaos playing out below.  ,We could see people running here and there ... [the soldiers] were killing everyone who was coming from the church,"" Desta said.  ,Eight eyewitnesses said they could tell the troops were Eritrean, based on their uniforms and dialect. Some speculated that soldiers were meting out revenge by targeting young men, assuming they were members of the TPLF forces or allied local militias. But Abraham and others maintained there were no militia in Dengelat or the church. ,Marta, who was visiting Dengelat for the holiday, says she left the church with her husband Biniam after morning prayers. As the newlyweds walked back to their relative's home, a stream of people began sprinting up the hill, shouting that soldiers were rounding people up in the village.  ,Biniam, left, and Marta on their wedding day.,{""@context"": ""http://schema.org"",""@type"": ""ImageObject"",""name"": ""Biniam, left, and Marta on their wedding day."",""description"": ""Biniam, left, and Marta on their wedding day."",""url"": ""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210226101512-ethiopia-investigation-biniam-wedding-large-169.jpg""}, ,She recalled the horrifying moment soldiers arrived at their house, shooting into the compound and calling out: ""Come out, come out you b*tches."" Marta said they went outside holding their identity cards aloft, saying ""we're civilians."" But the troops opened fire anyway, hitting Biniam, his sister and several others. ,""I was holding Bini, he wasn't dead ...

They were taking them barefoot and killing them in front of their mothers,"" Rahwa said eyewitnesses told her. ,Samuel, another eyewitness, said that he had eaten and drank with the soldiers before they came to his house, which is just behind the church, and killed his relatives. He said he survived by hiding underneath one of their bodies for hours. ,""They started pushing the people out of their houses and they were killing all children, women and old men. After they killed them outside their houses, they were looting and taking all the property,"" Samuel said.,As the violence raged, hundreds of people remained in the church hall. In a lull in the gunfire, priests advised those who could to go home, ushering them outside. Several of the priests were killed as they left the church, Abraham said.  ,With nowhere to run to, Abraham sheltered inside Maryam Dengelat, lying on the floor as artillery pounded the tin roof. ""We lost hope and we decided to stay and die at the church. We didn't try to run,"" he said. ,Two days later, the troops called parishioners down from the church to deal with the dead. Abraham said he and five other men spent the day burying bodies, including those from Marta's household and the Sunday school children. But the troops forbid them from burying bodies at the church, in line with Orthodox tradition, and forced them to make mass graves instead -- a practice that has been described elsewhere in Tigray. ,

The analysis was unable to conclusively identify individual graves, which witnesses said were shallow, but one expert said there were signs that parts of the landscape had changed.,The initial bloodshed was followed by a period of two tense weeks, Abraham said. Soldiers stayed in the area in several encampments, stealing cars, burning crops and killing livestock before eventually moving on. ,Tedros, who was born in Dengelat and traveled there after the soldiers had left, said that the village smelled of death and that vultures were circling over the mountains, a sign that there may be more bodies left uncounted there. ,""Some of them were also killed in the far fields while they were trying to escape and most of them were eaten by vultures before they got buried, it was horrible.

In interviews with villagers and family members, he compiled a death toll of more than 70 people.  ,The families hope that the names of their loved ones, which Tedros, Abraham and others risked their lives to record, will eventually be read out at a traditional funeral ceremony at the Maryam Dengelat church -- rare closure in an ongoing conflict.,Three months after the massacre, the graves in Dengelat are a daily reminder of the bloodshed for the survivors who remain in the village.

Some 110 million years ago, it formed at the bottom of a shallow inland sea. Basins are depressions in the earth's crust formed mostly by tectonic forces over hundreds of millions of years.,Think of an empty swimming pool; over a very, very long period of time, the pool is filled with material -- leaves, sand, organic matter. Hang around long enough and you won't see the swimming pool -- just the stuff inside it.,When the sediment is sitting at the right depth and is formed by the right mix of organic matter, such as the remains of dead animals or plants, it can, over tens of millions of years turn into oil, a resource that has helped drive the world economy for decades.,Today, that hunt for oil is triggering a fierce debate.,Supporters of drilling say the find could transform the fortunes of Namibia and Botswana, and that the countries have every right to exploit their own natural resources. After all, so the reasoning goes, the developed world has spent the past century exploiting its own fossil fuel reserves and getting rich in the process.,Opponents are using a familiar argument against oil exploration. They believe a major find could devastate regional ecosystems.,And they have a powerful tool in the fight against hydrocarbons: In the face of the climate crisis, and in a region uniquely vulnerable to rising temperatures, ,should oil be exploited, at all?  ,Staggering warming,Unlike neighboring Angola, Namibia doesn't have an oil industry of its own to speak of -- so far. Yet it is already being hammered by the world's dependency on fossil fuels.,""Southern Namibia already has twice the global rate of warming. In northern Namibia it is a staggering 3.6 degrees Celsius per century,"" said ,Francois Engelbrecht,, a professor at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa, and a lead author on the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.,

Those increasing temperatures will have a specific impact on the region.,When warm air rises over the equatorial region of Africa it goes on to sink over the sub-tropics, creating the Kalahari high pressure system that inhibits rain. Most common in the winter months, this weather system creates the semi-arid environment of the area.,But as the climate warms, those dry spells will become more frequent in the summer months, Engelbrecht said. The change in weather patterns and the corresponding increase in heat will create an even hotter and drier climate. It could destroy the way of life of the people who live here.,Farmers move cattle within the area ReconAfrica has gained rights to.

 ,  ,Hamdayet, Sudan -- ,More evidence of sexual violence being used as a deliberate weapon of war is emerging from ,Ethiopia's northern Tigray region,, where an armed conflict has been raging for months.,Women are being gang-raped, drugged and held hostage, according to medical records and testimonies from survivors shared with CNN. In one case a woman's vagina was stuffed with stones, nails and plastic, according to a video seen by CNN and testimony from one of the doctors who treated her. ,CNN has spoken with nine doctors in Ethiopia and one in a Sudanese refugee camp who say they've seen an alarming increase in sexual assault and rape cases since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launched a military operation against leaders in Tigray, sending in national troops and fighters from the country's Amhara region. Forces from neighboring Eritrea are participating in the military campaign on the side of Ethiopia's government, ,as CNN has previously reported,.,

 ,""He pushed me and said, 'You Tigrayans have no history, you have no culture. I can do what I want to you and no one cares.'"",
 ,Rape survivor in Hamdayet,
 ,According to the doctors, almost all the women they treat recount similar stories of being raped by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers. The women said the troops were on a self-proclaimed mission of retribution and were operating with near-total impunity in the region.,Read More,A CNN team in Hamdayet, a sleepy Sudanese town on the Ethiopian border where thousands of refugees from Tigray have gathered in recent months, spoke with several women who described being raped as they fled fighting. ,""He pushed me and said, 'You Tigrayans have no history, you have no culture. I can do what I want to you and no one cares,'"" one woman said of her attacker. She told CNN she is now pregnant. ,Many say they were raped by Amhara forces who told them they were intent on ethnically cleansing Tigray, a doctor working at the sprawling refugee camp in Hamdayet told CNN.,""The women that have been raped say that the things that they say to them when they were raping them is that they need to change their identity -- to either Amharize them or at least leave their Tigrinya status ... and that they've come there to cleanse them ... to cleanse the blood line,"" Dr. Tedros Tefera said.,""Practically this has been a genocide,"" he added.  ,The flood of refugees has become a trickle since Ethiopian forces reinforced the border in recent days, worrying refugees who are still hoping to be reunited with family members. ,The Ethiopian government didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on allegations that its forces are carrying out a coordinated campaign of sexual violence against women in Tigray.,Three days after CNN published this investigation, the Eritrean embassy of the UK and Ireland responded by denying allegations of wrongdoing by Eritrean soldiers and denying that Eritrean troops were in Ethiopia. ,Massacre in the mountains,Thousands of civilians are believed to have been killed in the conflict. CNN has previously reported that soldiers from neighboring Eritrea have perpetrated extrajudicial killings, assaults and human rights abuses in the Tigray region. Separate investigations by ,CNN, and ,Amnesty International, in February revealed evidence of massacres carried out by Eritrean forces in Dengelat and Axum. Eritrea's government has denied involvement in the atrocities.,The new reports of sexual violence come as US President Joe Biden dispatches Senator Chris Coons to meet with Abiy and convey US ""concerns about the humanitarian crisis and human rights abuses in the Tigray region."" The State Department has previously called for an independent investigation into atrocities committed during the war.,Ethiopia's government has severely restricted access to journalists until recently, making it challenging to verify survivors' accounts. And an intermittent communications blackout during the fighting has effectively blocked the war from the world's eyes. But in recent weeks, as foreign journalists have been allowed in, horrifying stories of rape and sexual violence are beginning to surface.,On Thursday, CNN affiliate ,Channel 4 News, published a harrowing report into sexual violence against women in Tigray. The report included interviews from a safe house -- the only one believed to be operating in Tigray for rape survivors -- where around 40 women too traumatized to return to their families are receiving shelter and support. ,

 ,Dr. Tedros Tefera,
 ,One of the survivors told Channel 4 News that she and five other women were gang-raped by 30 Eritrean soldiers who were joking and taking photos throughout the attack. She said she knew they were Eritrean troops because of their dialect and uniforms. She said she was able to return home only to be raped again. When she tried to escape, she recalled being captured, injected with a drug, tied to a rock, stripped, stabbed and raped by soldiers for 10 days.,Outside of the safe house, many more women and young girls are being treated in Ayder Referral Hospital, the main medical facility in the regional capital Mekelle. Most have been referred there by hospitals in rural areas that are not equipped to handle rape cases, Channel 4 News reported.,One doctor at the hospital told CNN that more than 200 women had been admitted for sexual violence in recent months, but many more cases have been reported in rural villages and centers for the internally displaced, with limited to no access to medical care.  ,The fighting in Tigray, which has included attacks on health care facilities, has severely restricted access to medical treatment, according to a ,report published Thursday by international medical humanitarian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF),. Of the 106 medical facilities MSF visited in the region, barely one in 10 were still operating, and one in five had been or was occupied by armed soldiers. One facility was being used as an army base, MSF said.,Between a lack of access to medical services and stigma surrounding sexual violence, doctors CNN interviewed said they suspect the true number of rape cases is much higher than official reports.,On February 10, the state-appointed ,Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC), admitted that the war and associated dismantling of the regional administration in Tigray had ""led to a rise in gender-based violence in the region."" ,A month later, on March 4, the United Nation's High Commissioner for Human Rights, ,Michelle Bachelet,, demanded an ""objective, independent assessment"" of the situation on the ground in Tigray.,UN rights chief says war crimes may have been committed in Ethiopia after CNN reveals Tigray massacre,According to ,the UN statement,, more than 136 cases of rape were reported in eastern region hospitals in Mekelle, Ayder, Adigrat and Wukro between December and January. ,One coordinator at a gender-based violence crisis center in Tigray told CNN they used to hear of cases every few days or once a week. Since the conflict broke out, up to 22 women and girls seek treatment for rape every day, she said.,Demand for emergency contraception and testing for sexually transmitted infections have also surged in recent months. Many of the women who have been raped have contracted sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, doctors told CNN.   ,One doctor said many of the women she treated were also physically abused, with broken bones and bruised body parts. She said the youngest girl she treated was 8 years old, while the oldest was 60.,The doctor said that many women who come forward share stories of others who haven't -- mothers, sisters, friends and other acquaintances. ,A spokesperson for the UN Human Rights Office told CNN that they would carry out a joint investigation with EHRC into allegations of serious human rights violations in Tigray.,Update, March 22: A comment from the Eritrean embassy of the UK and Ireland has been added to this story.,CNN's Nima Elbagir and Barbara Arvanitidis reported from Hamdayet.

,Dawit was watching television at a relative's one-room apartment in Axum, a historic city in Ethiopia's war-torn, northern Tigray region, in early March when a news bulletin flashed up on the screen.  ,Graphic, unverified footage had surfaced of a mass killing near Dawit's hometown of Mahibere Dego, in a mountainous area of central Tigray. In the shaky video Ethiopian soldiers appeared to round up a group of young, unarmed men on a wind-swept, dusty ledge before shooting them at point-blank range -- picking them up by an arm or a leg and flinging or kicking their bodies off a rocky hillside like ragdolls. ,The soldiers can be heard in the footage urging one another not to waste bullets, to use the minimum amount needed to kill and to make sure none of the group were left alive. They also appear to cheer each other on, praising the killings as heroic and hurling insults at the men in their captivity. ,Dawit said he believes one of the men in the video, broadcast on a diaspora television station Tigrai Media House (TMH), was his younger brother, Alula. CNN has changed the names of both brothers for Dawit's safety. ,The mass killing near Mahibere Dego is ,one of several, to have been reported over the course of Ethiopia's five-month-old conflict during which thousands of civilians are believed to have been killed, raped and abused. But with independent access to journalists severely restricted until recently and telephone and internet services often blocked, it has been challenging to verify accounts of atrocities in Tigray. Amid the effective communications blackout, few videos have emerged from the fighting and those that have are difficult to authenticate.,Read More,Through a forensic frame-by-frame investigation of the video footage -- corroborated by analysis from Amnesty International's digital verification and modeling experts -- as well as interviews with 10 family members and local residents, CNN has established that men wearing Ethiopian army uniforms executed a group of at least 11 unarmed men before disposing of their bodies near Mahibere Dego.   ,

,Dawit said he last saw his 23-year-old brother -- in the same clothes he is seen wearing in the video -- at their mother's house in Mahibere Dego on January 15. The video is not timestamped and CNN does not have the original, raw footage to examine the file's metadata but it is likely the video was filmed that same day.,Dawit was out in the fields looking after his cattle when he said Ethiopian soldiers arrived in the town and went door-to-door dragging young men, including his brother, from their homes.,The troops shot at him, Dawit said, and he ran into the bush to escape, breaking his leg as he scrambled down a rocky path. Later, he said he could hear gunfire in the distance, and then silence.  ,Until he watched the video, he said he had no idea what had happened to his brother. But even after watching the footage countless times, Dawit said he is still holding out hope Alula is alive.  ,CNN is not able to independently verify that Alula is pictured in the footage, and the man that Dawit identifies as his brother is not identifiable among the dead. ,""Since we didn't see his body with our own eyes and bury our brother ourselves, it's hard for us to believe he's dead. It feels like he's still alive, we can't accept his death,"" Dawit said. ,""We will always remember him."",.m-infographic_1617293068534{background:url(//cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2021/04/01/01-Ethiopia_investigation_Tigray_map_375px-b.png) no-repeat 0 0 transparent;margin-bottom:30px;width:100%;-moz-background-size:cover;-o-background-size:cover;-webkit-background-size:cover;background-size:cover;font-size:0;}.m-infographic_1617293068534:before{content:"""";display:block;padding-top:229.83%;}@media (min-width:640px) {.m-infographic_1617293068534 {background-image:url(//cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2021/04/01/01-Ethiopia_investigation_Tigray_map_780px-b.png);}.m-infographic_1617293068534:before{padding-top:118%;}}@media (min-width:1120px) {.m-infographic_1617293068534 {background-image:url(//cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2021/04/01/01-Ethiopia_investigation_Tigray_map_780px-b.png);}.m-infographic_1617293068534:before{padding-top:118%;}},After the attack, Dawit fled Mahibere Dego with two of his teenage siblings, limping 12 miles to their eldest brother's home in Axum; hundreds of other residents displaced from the town and surrounding area are now sleeping rough in the city's streets.  ,Dawit said the only people left in the town are those too elderly to make the trek -- including his own mother. She doesn't have internet access or satellite TV, so she hasn't seen the gruesome video. Dawit has spoken to her over the phone -- telephone networks in Mahibere Dego have been intermittent -- but he hasn't mentioned the footage. For now, he said, it is easier that way.  ,Ethiopia is facing a raft of intense scrutiny over human rights violations that ,may amount to war crimes, in its Tigray region. Thousands of civilians are believed to have been killed since November, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launched a major military operation against Tigray's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), sending in national troops and militia fighters from Ethiopia's Amhara region. ,CNN has previously compiled extensive eyewitness testimony that soldiers from neighboring Eritrea had crossed into Tigray and were perpetrating ,massacres,, extrajudicial killings, ,sexual violence, and other abuses. ,The state-appointed ,Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, last week said its investigations found preliminary evidence that more than 100 people in Axum were killed by Eritrean soldiers in November, confirming earlier reports by ,Amnesty International, and ,Human Rights Watch,. ,In late March, ,Medecins Sans Frontieres, said its staffers had witnessed Ethiopian soldiers drag several men off public buses and execute them near the Tigray capital, Mekelle.,Abiy said last week his government would ,hold accountable any soldier, found responsible for committing atrocities in Tigray -- acknowledging for the first time that ,Eritrean troops, were fighting alongside Ethiopian forces and that they would withdraw from border areas. It is not clear whether Eritrean forces have pulled out of Tigray. ,The Eritrean embassy of the UK and Ireland responded to CNN's repeated requests for comment on March 22, denying allegations of wrongdoing by Eritrean soldiers and denying that Eritrean troops were in Ethiopia. ,For months, both countries denied that Eritrean troops were in the war-torn region, and insisted no civilians have been killed in the conflict, contradicting accounts from residents, refugees, aid agencies, diplomats and Ethiopian civilian officials. ,If the soldiers in the Mahibere Dego video are indeed Ethiopian National Defense Forces then it may be the first visual evidence of Ethiopia's involvement in war crimes., ,The Ethiopian government and its interim administration in Tigray did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on the video and accusations that its forces abducted scores of men from the Mahibere Dego area., ,On Friday, after CNN's investigation published, Abiy's office said in a statement that ""social media posts and claims cannot be taken as evidence, regardless of whether Western media report it or not."" The statement added that the government ""has indicated its open will for independent investigations to be undertaken in the Tigray region."",

,The footage was initially broadcast in early March by ,Tigrai Media House (TMH),, a pro-Tigray subscription satellite TV and YouTube channel based in the United States, and has widely circulated on social media in the weeks since.,Stalin Gebreselassie, a TMH journalist and presenter based in Washington, DC, told CNN he was sent the gruesome footage via a source in Tigray. The source told him that the video was filmed on a mobile phone by an Ethiopian army soldier turned whistleblower involved in the mass killing.  ,TMH paid the whistleblower directly for the footage, Gebreselassie said, so that he could leave Ethiopia and go into hiding. As part of the agreement, TMH waited until they had received word that he was safely outside the country before broadcasting the video.  ,""I managed to talk to him only for three minutes. The words he uttered to me were: 'I'm so sorry brother ... I am really sorry for what I did in Tigray, the Tigrayan people don't deserve this,'"" Gebreselassie said, describing his call with the whistleblower. Gebreselassie said that the whistleblower appeared to regret his involvement in the killing, and told him that he was sharing the video with TMH ""to heal"" and ""expose what the Ethiopian government was doing to its own people."" ,CNN was unsuccessful in its attempts to reach the soldier directly, and does not know the extent of the soldier's involvement in the atrocities.,Gebreselassie said the footage was sent to him on WhatsApp in five compressed video clips, due to persistent internet bandwidth issues in Tigray, but maintains it was all filmed by the soldier on one device.  ,Without the raw footage and associated metadata, CNN cannot confirm the original device the five videos were filmed on, who filmed them, the date they were filmed or whether they were selectively edited.  ,Still, CNN was able to geolocate the video to a rugged clifftop three miles south of Mahibere Dego, identifying the terrain, tree line, vegetation and shape of the mountains on Google Earth. ,Separately, Amnesty International said it confirmed the location in all five video clips using 3D modeling software that overlaid the footage on top of satellite imagery of the location.,

	,Amnesty International used 3D modeling software to match the footage to satellite imagery of the location outside Mahibere Dego. ,Credit: Amnesty International,
,""A preliminary geolocation for the site required additional spatial verification. The link between the collected footage and the location was then verified through spatial analysis and reconstruction,"" Martyna Marciniak, a visual investigator who built the 3D model for Amnesty International, said.  ,To corroborate the specific time of day the video was filmed, CNN conducted shadow analysis using a tool called SunCalc. Based on the long shadows, it suggests the massacre was carried out in the late afternoon. ,In freeze-frames of the footage, soldiers can be seen wearing uniforms with embroidered Ethiopian national flag patches on the shoulder and black ""Ethiopian Army"" stitching on the lapel.

In an attempt to get the word out about what happened to them, several residents compiled a list of those who went missing -- as many as 39 men. The list of names, as well as photos of 18 of the men, were shared directly with CNN. CNN has verified the identities of several of the 18 but has not established if they are the same men in the grainy video footage from the cliff., ,Three different sources have told CNN that 39 men are still missing from Mahibere Dego. In one video, soldiers can be seen rounding up dozens of men, and in another clip, the bodies of at least 11 men are piled in a heap on the hillside. CNN has not been able to identify whether they are the same men. ,Dawit and other residents said Ethiopian troops had been fighting in another town nearby before coming to Mahibere Dego. Some residents speculated that soldiers were meting out revenge by targeting young men, assuming they were members of the TPLF forces or allied local militias.  ,

Dawit said his brother Alula was not a fighter, nor were his neighbors, eight of whom were also taken from their homes and are believed to have been killed.  ,Dawit and other residents said they recognized the location shown in the video based on the terrain and vegetation. ""When I watched the video again and again, I [realized I] knew the place and it is not far from our small town and village.

Due to a blockade of the area, relatives and residents have not been able to visit the site to identify a mass grave. ,Nearly three months later, Dawit and his siblings are still unable to return to Mahibere Dego. Dawit said they want to tell their mother what happened to Alula in person and hold a memorial, but as long as the soldiers are still in the town, it's too risky. ,""It's very difficult to express my bitter sadness,"" Dawit said, adding that his brother was well-loved. ,""There are not enough words to express ... losing my brother in this way."",CNN's Eliza Mackintosh wrote and reported from London.

,Axum, Ethiopia, — Eritrean troops are operating with total impunity in Ethiopia's war-torn northern Tigray region, ,killing,, ,raping, and blocking humanitarian aid to starving populations more than a month after the country's ,Nobel Peace Prize winning leader, pledged to the international community that they would leave.,A CNN team traveling through Tigray's central zone witnessed Eritrean soldiers, some disguising themselves in old Ethiopian military uniforms, manning checkpoints, obstructing and occupying critical aid routes, roaming the halls of one of the region's few operating hospitals and threatening medical staff. ,Despite pressure from the ,Biden administration,, there is no sign that Eritrean forces plan to exit the border region anytime soon. ,On April 21, a CNN team reporting in Tigray with the permission of Ethiopian authorities traveled from the regional capital Mekelle to the besieged city of ,Axum,, two weeks after it had been sealed off by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers. An aid convoy also made the seven-hour journey. ,

,Ethiopia's government has severely restricted access to the media until recently, and a state-enforced communications blackout concealed events in the region, making it challenging to gauge the extent of the crisis or verify survivors' accounts. ,Read More,But CNN's interviews with humanitarian workers, doctors, soldiers and displaced people in Axum and across central Tigray -- where up to 800,000 displaced people are sheltering -- indicate the situation is even worse than was feared. Eritrean troops aren't just working hand in glove with the Ethiopian government, assisting in a merciless campaign against the Tigrayan people, in some pockets they're fully in control and waging a reign of terror.,The testimonies, shared at great personal risk, present a horrifying picture of the situation in Tigray, where a clash between Prime Minister ,Abiy Ahmed, and the region's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), in November has deteriorated into a protracted conflict that, by many accounts, bears the hallmarks of genocide and has the potential to destabilize the wider Horn of Africa region.,.m-infographic_1620906311283{background:url(//cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2021/05/13/1-Ethiopia_investigation_Tigray_map_May2021_375px-1.png) no-repeat 0 0 transparent;margin-bottom:30px;width:100%;-moz-background-size:cover;-o-background-size:cover;-webkit-background-size:cover;background-size:cover;font-size:0;}.m-infographic_1620906311283:before{content:"""";display:block;padding-top:175.1%;}@media (min-width:640px) {.m-infographic_1620906311283 {background-image:url(//cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2021/05/13/1-Ethiopia_investigation_Tigray_map_May2021_930px-1.png);}.m-infographic_1620906311283:before{padding-top:88.12%;}}@media (min-width:1120px) {.m-infographic_1620906311283 {background-image:url(//cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2021/05/13/1-Ethiopia_investigation_Tigray_map_May2021_930px-1.png);}.m-infographic_1620906311283:before{padding-top:88.12%;}},Ethiopian security officials working with Tigray's interim administration told CNN that the Ethiopian government has no control over Eritrean soldiers operating in Ethiopia, and that Eritrean forces had blocked roads into central Tigray for over two weeks and in the northwestern part of the region for nearly one month. ,As the war and its impact on civilians deepens, world leaders have voiced their concern about the role of Eritrean forces in exacerbating what US Secretary of State ,Antony Blinken,, according to spokesperson Ned Price, has described as a ""growing humanitarian disaster."" In a phone call with Abiy on April 26, Blinken pressed Ethiopia and Eritrea to make good on commitments to withdraw Eritrean troops ""in full, and in a verifiable manner."",CNN's efforts to reach Axum were thwarted by both Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers multiple times over several days.,

,On one of the first attempts, the CNN team encountered what it later learned was the aftermath of a grenade attack, where a group of local residents were flagging down cars, warning passersby not to go any further. But before we reached the scene, a large army truck drove up and parked sideways, blocking the road. Our cameraman got out of the car and started filming only to be confronted by Ethiopian soldiers, who threatened the team with detention, demanding that we hand over the camera and delete the footage. But we refused and were able to conceal the footage until we were eventually released. ,

,On another occasion, CNN was turned back by an Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF) Command operating out of a former USAID distribution center in the outskirts of the city of Adigrat, where several trucks laden with sacks of desperately needed food sat languishing in the hot sun. The aid, bound for communities in Tigray's starved central zone, had been stopped from going any further despite daily phone calls from humanitarian workers pleading for access.,Even after being granted entry to Axum by the Ethiopian military, CNN's path was obstructed by Eritrean troops controlling a checkpoint on a desolate mountain top overlooking Adigrat. The forces were wearing a mixture of their official light-colored Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF) fatigues and a woodland camouflage with a green beret, which military experts verified as tallying with old Ethiopian army uniforms.,It is one of the first visual confirmations of reports -- relayed in recent weeks by the UN's top humanitarian official Mark Lowcock and US ambassador to the UN ,Linda Thomas-Greenfield, -- that Eritrean soldiers are disguising their identities by re-uniforming as Ethiopian military, in what Thomas-Greenfield described as a move to ""remain in Tigray indefinitely.""  ,CNN was informed by aid agencies that they had also been turned back by Eritrean soldiers manning the same checkpoint. Ethiopian military sources in the region confirmed to CNN that Eritrean soldiers were in control of key checkpoints along the route to Axum. The military sources said they had requested multiple times for the Eritreans to allow cars and convoys through, but had been refused. ,CNN has reached out to the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments for comment. ,Eritrean soldiers are captured on a hidden camera at a checkpoint in the hills above Adigrat, as they block access to the road to Axum. ,{""@context"": ""http://schema.org"",""@type"": ""ImageObject"",""name"": ""Eritrean soldiers are captured on a hidden camera at a checkpoint in the hills above Adigrat, as they block access to the road to Axum.

On the same day, international medical humanitarian organization ,Medecins Sans Frontieres, demanded that the 12-day blockade of the road into Axum be lifted. ,Many aid agencies are still being barred from the besieged city, where one of the few hospitals operating for miles is running out of essential supplies, including oxygen and blood, humanitarian workers working in the region told CNN.  ,On arrival at the Axum University Teaching and Referral Hospital, patients are greeted by a sign asking for blood.,The medical staff we spoke to asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, but requested that CNN identify their hospital -- they say that they want people to know that they are still here.,Inside one of the under-resourced examination rooms, a malnourished 7-year-old was lying on a gurney, wrapped in a blanket to cushion her fragile skin. Latebrahan's emaciated legs could no longer hold her weight and she lay wide-eyed, staring up at the crowd of doctors gathered around her bed. ,Seven-year-old Latebrahan lies on a gurney at Axum University Teaching and Referral Hospital, where she's being treated for malnourishment.,{""@context"": ""http://schema.org"",""@type"": ""ImageObject"",""name"": ""Seven-year-old Latebrahan lies on a gurney at Axum University Teaching and Referral Hospital, where she&#39;s being treated for malnourishment."",""description"": ""Seven-year-old Latebrahan lies on a gurney at Axum University Teaching and Referral Hospital, where she&#39;s being treated for malnourishment."",""url"": ""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210504165904-02-cnn-tigray-axum-aid-blockade-large-169.jpg""},The medical team were doing their best to keep her alive, but they had run out of a therapeutic feeding agent ,due to the blockade,, the only way to help her gain weight without disturbing her delicate system.  ,Latebrahan's father, Girmay, who asked to be identified only by his first name, told CNN the journey from their home in Chila, around 60 miles north of Axum, near the border with Eritrea, had been dangerous and costly.,""There is no help, no food, nothing. I didn't have a choice though -- look at her,"" Girmay said. ,Like many other rural border towns, Chila has been blocked off from receiving aid since the conflict began six months ago. Humanitarian workers say famine could have already arrived there and they would have no way of knowing.,""Based on guesswork there is a sense that in these areas that we are not able to access, out in the countryside for instance, places are falling into pockets of famine. But we're not able to verify that and that's part of the problem,"" Thomas Thompson, the UN World Food Programme's emergency coordinator, told CNN.,The fighting erupted during the autumn harvest season following the worst invasion of desert ,locusts, in Ethiopia in decades. The conflict has plunged Tigray even further into severe food insecurity, and the deliberate blockade of food risks mass starvation, a recent report by the ,World Peace Foundation, warned. The Ethiopian government itself estimates that at least 5.2 million people out of 5.7 million in the region are in need of emergency food assistance.,USAID distributes supplies in Hawzen, central Tigray, where residents hadn't received aid for two months.,{""@context"": ""http://schema.org"",""@type"": ""ImageObject"",""name"": ""USAID distributes supplies in Hawzen, central Tigray, where residents hadn&#39;t received aid for two months."",""description"": ""USAID distributes supplies in Hawzen, central Tigray, where residents hadn&#39;t received aid for two months."",""url"": ""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210504165912-03-cnn-tigray-axum-aid-blockade-large-169.jpg""},Eritrean soldiers have been blocking and looting food relief in multiple parts of Tigray, including in Samre and Gijet, southwest of Mekele, according to a leaked document from the Emergency Coordination Centre of Tigray's Abiy-appointed interim government obtained by CNN. In a PowerPoint presentation dated April 23, the center states that Eritrean soldiers have also started showing up at food distribution points in Tigray, looting supplies after ""our beneficiaries became frightened and [ran] away."" ,That report was corroborated by humanitarian workers in Tigray, who said they had ""protection"" issues around distributing aid in some areas as civilians were later robbed of the aid by Eritrean soldiers. Emily Dakin, who leads the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team in Tigray, also told CNN that she had received reports of health centers being looted, which was ""contributing to some of the dysfunctionality of the hospitals."",Eritrea's Minister of Information ,Yemane Meskel, has rejected these claims.,Hannibal, 7, is treated at Axum Teaching and Referral Hospital for a gunshot wound to the leg, which he received from soldiers' gunfire as he was sitting on his mother's lap.,{""@context"": ""http://schema.org"",""@type"": ""ImageObject"",""name"": ""Hannibal, 7, is treated at Axum Teaching and Referral Hospital for a gunshot wound to the leg, which he received from soldiers&#39; gunfire as he was sitting on his mother&#39;s lap."",""description"": ""Hannibal, 7, is treated at Axum Teaching and Referral Hospital for a gunshot wound to the leg, which he received from soldiers&#39; gunfire as he was sitting on his mother&#39;s lap."",""url"": ""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210504165928-04-cnn-tigray-axum-aid-blockade-large-169.jpg""},Eritrea's power in the region feels absolute even in the Axum Teaching Hospital, where Eritrean soldiers are among the gun-toting troops roaming the corridors, dropping off wounded soldiers and threatening medical staff. It is a terrifying scene for patients, many of whom say they were injured either directly or indirectly by soldiers.,One doctor, who asked not to be named, told CNN that the siege had prompted a surge in patients. In addition to cases of malnutrition like Latebrahan, doctors and nurses are treating a grim array of trauma from shrapnel, bullets, stabbings and rapes. In a desperate attempt to keep pace with demand, medical workers have also begun donating blood.  ,A sign at Axum University Teaching and Referral Hospital reads: ""Blood Campaign, for mothers, for children, for all those that need it."",{""@context"": ""http://schema.org"",""@type"": ""ImageObject"",""name"": ""A sign at Axum University Teaching and Referral Hospital reads: &quot;Blood Campaign, for mothers, for children, for all those that need it.&quot;"",""description"": ""A sign at Axum University Teaching and Referral Hospital reads: &quot;Blood Campaign, for mothers, for children, for all those that need it.&quot;"",""url"": ""//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210504165920-05-cnn-tigray-axum-aid-blockade-large-169.jpg""},But despite this, there wasn't enough blood on hand to save one young woman, who had been attacked by soldiers who tried to rape her. ,The doctor treating the woman told CNN that the hospital had seen a spike in sexual assault cases over recent weeks, but that the rise was just ""the tip of the iceberg,"" as many were too scared to seek medical services.,An alarming number of women are being gang-raped, drugged and held hostage in the conflict, in which sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war and its use linked to ,genocide,. According to one agency's estimate, almost one-third of all attacks on civilians involve sexual violence, the majority committed by men in uniform.  ,An autopsy photo of the young woman seen by CNN showed her internal organs spilling out from a wound in her lower abdomen.,""She came to our emergency department and she had a sign of life initially. [But] if you find blood for a patient, it's only one or two units and one or two units could not save this woman. She bled [out] and she died,"" the doctor said haltingly, overcome with emotion.,He took a deep breath, then added, ""I see this woman in my dreams."",This reporting would not have been possible without the support of dozens of Tigrayans, who shared their stories at great personal risk. CNN is not naming them to protect their safety. It also builds on a series of investigations into massacres and sexual violence in Tigray by CNN's Bethlehem Feleke, Gianluca Mezzofiore and Katie Polglase. ,Read CNN's full Tigray coverage here,.,Nima Elbagir and Barbara Arvanitidis reported from Axum.

Working, socializing, and even banking have increasingly moved online. ,Safaricom, the largest telecommunications provider in Kenya, saw growth in its money transfer platform M-Pesa as it waived fees for small transactions, in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus through in-person payments. Launched in Kenya in 2007, M-Pesa is now available in seven African countries and used for transactions worth $12 billion each month, according to Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa.,He believes that by encouraging people to use online services, Covid-19 has accelerated connectivity in Africa.

Many of these countries are African or South American nations. However, European countries that are currently experiencing a third wave of cases, such as France, are not on the list.  ,The decision to add Kenya to the 'red list' comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed April as ""second dose month,"" with the country giving more second doses than first doses of the vaccine per day for the first time on March 30.,Over ,31 million people in the UK ,have now received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and more than 5 million have also received their second shot, according to the latest government data. ,The UK is seeing a decline in Covid-19 deaths and cases and is taking steps to open up its economy, while Kenya is currently battling a, third wave of Covid-19,. ,London records zero Covid-19 daily deaths for first time in six months as cases soar elsewhere in Europe,On March 26, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced curfews and a ban on almost all movement in or out of the country's biggest cities, including the capital Nairobi, to tackle the outbreak. ,International flights were the exception to that travel ban. ,However, the UK has seen far more deaths throughout the pandemic than Kenya. ,Kenya's total reported Covid-19 ,death toll on Tuesday, stood at 2,258, according to the country's Ministry of Health. The ,UK's total death toll, has topped more than 126,000, according to its government data. ,And the daily new confirmed Covid-19 cases per million people in Kenya as of April 6 is 19.2, while the UK stands at 48.75, according to ,Oxford University's Our World in Data. ,The number of confirmed cases is lower in many countries than the number of actual cases, due to reasons such as limited testing, according to Our World in Data.,""We have demonstrated incredible responsibility here.

However, it has not received all these doses yet and not all of these candidates have yet been approved by the UK's medicines regulator. ,It is currently administering the Oxford/AstraZeneca and BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines and announced Wednesday it will begin a rollout of the Moderna vaccine too. ,The UK Foreign Office declined to comment on the Kenyan statement when contacted by CNN.

Its authors say it is the first comprehensive continent-wide analysis of the pandemic in Africa.,The data showed that while an average of 18,273 daily new cases were being reported across the continent during the first peak of the epidemic in mid-July, this number rose to an average of 23,790 by the end of December when 36 of the African Union's 55 states had experienced or were ,experiencing a second wave,.,Western countries have 'hoarded' Covid vaccines. Africa is being left behind as cases surge,Dr. John Nkengasong, the director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and one of the authors of the study, said the more aggressive second wave was likely caused by several factors, including a lower adherence to health measures such as mask wearing and social distancing, as well as the emergence of the new, ,more infectious variants,.,""These insights also reveal a need to improve testing capacity and reinvigorate public health campaigns, to re-emphasize the importance of abiding by measures that aim to strike a fine balance between controlling the spread of Covid-19 and sustaining economies and people's livelihoods,"" he added in a statement. ,Read More,However, Nkengasong told CNN public health measures alone will not be enough to stop further waves of the pandemic in Africa. ""Without urgent scale-up of the vaccines, we will definitely see the third wave, which has already started in some African countries,"" he said.,""Vaccines protectionism will definitely make the situation worse, and ... will be detrimental to the global efforts to win the battle against Covid 19,"" he added.,Coronavirus variant discoveries in UK and South Africa began with a bet of a bottle of wine ,African countries are lagging behind the rest of the world in ,vaccination rollouts,, because the majority of countries on the continent have not yet received any vaccine deliveries. ,African countries  are largely relying on the COVAX scheme, a global vaccine-sharing initiative that provides discounted or free doses for lower-income countries. The supply is very limited, though. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 90 million doses will be provided to Africa in the first half of this year. That's enough to immunize just 3% of the continent's population. As more vaccines become available, the aim is to vaccinate at least 20% by the end of the year, WHO said.,In comparison, the United States is planning to make vaccines ,available to all adults by May 1,. The United Kingdom has already vaccinated more than half of all adults and is aiming to offer the vaccine to everyone by the end of July. The European Union said Wednesday it wants to vaccinate 70% of its citizens by the end of summer. ,Several countries hit very hard,The study said that while case numbers and deaths in ,Africa as a whole were still low, compared to many other parts of the world, several countries had experienced very high infection rates. ,Covid-19 drove hundreds of Africans out of Guangzhou. A generation of mixed-race children is their legacy,Of the nearly 3 million Covid-19 cases and more than 65,000 deaths reported in Africa between mid February 2020 and the end of the year, more than 82% were reported in just nine countries. South Africa was the hardest hit, with more than 38% of all African cases reported there. Morocco saw nearly 16% of all cases while Tunisia, Egypt and Ethiopia reported around 5% of total cases each. ,Cape Verde, South Africa and Libya were the three countries that reported the highest cumulative incidence rates, while 18 of the 55 states reported higher case fatality ratio than the global average, meaning a higher proportion of those officially diagnosed with Covid-19 have died. ,The authors of the study said that early intervention in many African countries kept the first wave of the pandemic relatively under control.,Writing for CNN last year,, Yale economist Mushfiq Mubarak said the experience of dealing with prior epidemics prompted several African leaders to react quickly. ,Senegal, Rwanda, Mauritius and Liberia began planning their response as soon as the virus alerts were sent internationally and began screening and quarantining travelers at the airport. Ghana and Nigeria banned travel between cities and implemented curfews.,Mubarak added that many African countries also focused on expanding testing and contact tracing very early in the pandemic. Senegal built infrastructure that allowed coronavirus test results to be generated within 24 hours. Rwanda and Sierra Leone repurposed their HIV and Ebola equipment for coronavirus tracking, testing, and quarantining. South Africa, Cameroon, Mauritania, Ghana, Rwanda, Senegal, and parts of Nigeria have set up large-scale community door-to-door campaigns to test, treat, and isolate potential Covid patients.,COVAX offers hope of vaccine equality with roll out across Africa,Looking at the 50 states for which data about public health and social measures were available, the researchers found that 36 put stringent restrictions in place on average 15 days before reporting their first case. The other 14 countries implemented them on average just nine days after their first coronavirus case -- which is still much earlier than many other countries around the world.,The vast majority of the countries had five of more measures in place, including international travel controls, schools closures and bans on public events and mass gatherings. ,However, the researchers found that even though the second wave of the epidemic was more severe, it led to fewer and less stringent public health measures. They said in order to prevent further waves of the coronavirus pandemic from becoming even worse, African leaders need to double down on public health measures and work to improve their testing capacities.,CNN's Stephanie Busari and Nimi Princewill contributed reporting.
